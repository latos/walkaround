  <!--
    This entire GWT module exists for just one proto, the hashed version, which
    is used by other protos in the web client.  The hashed version proto
    probably belongs in the core model, rather than here in federation.
    Most of the code in this package is not GWT compatible, so a stricter
    inclusion rule is used: a whitelist of safe files, rather than a blacklist
    of known offenders.
